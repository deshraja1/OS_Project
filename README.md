## Next Frame Prediction using CNNs and LSTMs

The performance of different models based on Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory is evaluated on a dataset of cats gifs.

The models used are
  1. Baseline model which just returns the last layer
  2. Conv3D
  3. Conv3D with Gaussian Noise
  4. Conv2DLSTM with Gaussian Noise

The results are visualised using WandB (Weights and Biases).
